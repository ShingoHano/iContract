iContract
======================

iContract is a precious application that manages the contract period.   
Medium-turm and long-term contract of such as phone are usually nice services include discount,  
however it has penalty in case of early termination,and the timing of updates or changes of the contract is difficult to fit.     

So iContract will support the contract management of points "the setting of the contract period",  
"management of the penalty",and "notification of specified days prior to the maturity date".
